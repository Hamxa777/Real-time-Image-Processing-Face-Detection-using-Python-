# Real-time-Image-Processing-Face-Detection-using-Python
EExam Cheating Identifier project, developed with Python, OpenCV, Dlib, and Tkinter, employs image
processing to detect and prevent cheating during exams. It captures and analyzes exam environments in
realtime, using facial recognition to match students' identities and OpenCV to spot cheating behaviors. Suspicious
activity triggers immediate alerts through a user-friendly Tkinter frontend, enabling swift intervention by exam
proctors. This solution enhances exam security, maintains fairness, and plans for future machine learning
enhancements to adapt to evolving cheating techniques, while also considering integration with online exam
platforms for remote monitoring. Tools: Python · OpenCV · dlib · Numpy · tkinter (GUI) · Jupiter Notebook
